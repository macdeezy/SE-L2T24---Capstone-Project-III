# SE-L2T24---Capstone-Project-III

Compulsory Task
Follow these steps:
● Design your program to meet the specifications given by the client.
Extend the program that you have written in previous Capstone Projects
so that this program also:
o Reads details about existing projects from a text file and uses this
information to create a list of project objects.
o Allows a user to add new objects to this list.
o Allows a user to select and update or finalise any project on the list.
o Allows a user to see a list of projects that still need to be completed.
o Allows a user to see a list of projects that are past the due date.
o Writes the updated details about the projects to the text file when
the program ends.
● Besides meeting the above criteria, you should also do the following:
o Make sure that your program includes exception handling. Use
try-catch blocks wherever appropriate. This should include ensuring
that your program handles exceptions related to writing or reading
to/from text files and exceptions related to acquiring user input.
o Make sure that you have completely removed all errors from your
code. Take extra care to ensure that logical and runtime errors have
been detected and removed.
o Make sure that your code has been adequately refactored.
o Make sure that your code is adequately documented. Adhere to the
style guide found here.
o Use Javadoc to generate API documentation from documentation
comments for your program.
● Submit your fully debugged and refactored code and the documentation
for your project to your mentor.
● After receiving feedback from your mentor and improving your code
based on this feedback, add your program to Github.
